Ramblings on Dostoevsky's _The Idiot_.

Reading Dostoevsky is always an experience. His insight into the human mind really
is on another level. He does a particularly good job of bringing you into the 
chaos of the story. I wish I could read him in his original language.

I love the whole central theme of _The Idiot_. The characteristics that lead others
to call the protagonist "an idiot" are true innocence and purity (I wish I had).
The protagonist of _Man Alive_ is also misunderstood by his peers and thought to 
be insane (though his innocence takes on a different form).

It's a tragic ending (not unexpected) unlike Crime and Punishment. It is ironic that 
Nastasya, in her attempt to "do good by" the prince and let him be free, she 
essentially ruins his life. Dostoevsky's portrayal of her vascillations between 
her view of herself as base and wretched and the sentiment that she has been the 
innocent victim are also profound.

The introduction of and pontificating around the painting _The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb_
are also deeply fascinating. The painting itself is also fascinating. The prince
notes that it might damage ones faith. I think it may also serve to strengthen's
ones faith provided they believe in the resurrection. That Jesus himself stooped
to death, gruesome and real as portrayed here, can lead to a deeper trust in God, 
seeing He suffered so.
