initial rambling thoughts on little women...

This is one of my favorite books.

Very well written. The author's character description demonstrates her understanding of the human
thought and feeling. I was delighted simply in anticipation of reading the author describe a 
character's experience of any given event. Not only is the language brilliant, but there is a 
lot of wisdom packed into the often witty and clever descriptions. Her ability to sneak in such 
wisdom reminds me of C.S. Lewis (high praise!). The writing style using long sentences is in 
contrast to what is in vogue nowadays, but it never goes on in a way as to confuse or muddle 
her meaning. 

The book is inspiring. It makes me long to be a parent as Mrs. and Mr. March are to their
children. It reminds us of the creativity in children, provided we do not steal it from them.
It helps me see the beauty in giving my life to serve another. It deepens my trust in God, who 
is the one who works change in our hearts for good, and demonstrates well that patiently waiting
and holding one's tongue is often most wise.

This book made me cry.

I have 341 highlights in this book, by far the most of any book I've read on kindle, most of which
are of the delightful and erudite descriptions that never seem to end.

The book is realistic.

  It spurned the "happy ending" that at least I longed for. It hurt that Jo would not 
  reciprocate Laurie's feelings. At the same time I knew it had to be so.
  It's the same reason Omar must die and unheroically too. There are no heroes but one, and there
  would be none at all if we see only through earthly eyes.

I'm honestly surprised it would be made into a movie in 2019, but that speaks to how wonderfully
told a story it is, even if its morals might be dated to the young modern day American.
